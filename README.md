For my final project for my Data Structures Class I designed a program that uses a GraphAPI class to take an input of a graph of cities and create the Incidence matrix, BFS/DFS traversal, Strong Connectedness, Topological ordering, and Kruskal's MST using a menu that prompts the user. This project was made in Java.
